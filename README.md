I wrote this program to solve of problem of "How much should you put into Roth 401k compared to regular 401k" and the result of this program is quite interesting and at the same time, not so surprising. While the tax law frequently changes and your salary won't always stay the same throughout your career, these Swift code can give you a good sense how your 401k will look like in 40 years.

Basically, if you're an aggressive investor like I am, go ALL-IN for the Roth 401k! Because in 40 years, your 401k balance will be somewhere in the range of 10-20 million dollars which will put your average tax rate close to the tax rate in the highest tax bracket(extremely high compared to your income tax rate right now which is the rate you will be taxed for the Roth 401k)! Plus the tax rate is almost guaranteed to go up because of the tremendous amount of debt the nation is in right now. To get a high yield close to 12%(the rate of return for S&P 500 for the past 10 years, generally known as "the stock market"), I highly recommend building an investment portfolio comprised of growth STOCK mutal funds. The art of picking mutual funds is beyond the scope of this topic, but as a wise investor, you should always understand what you are getting into.

Personally, I think the financial world is a fascinating place. Hit me up if you have some interesting ideas regarding investing or the code in this program!
